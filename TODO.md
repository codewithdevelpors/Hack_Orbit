# Language Persistence Implementation Plan

## Information Gathered
- The app uses i18next for internationalization with translations for 20 languages.
- Current setup initializes with default 'en' language without persistence.
- Languages page allows selection but doesn't save the choice.
- Navbar displays current language but relies on i18n.language state.

## Plan
1. Add language storage key to constants
2. Update i18n.js to load persisted language on initialization
3. Modify Languages.js to persist selected language in localStorage
4. Test language persistence across page reloads

## Dependent Files to Edit
- client/src/constants/index.js: Add language storage key
- client/src/i18n.js: Load persisted language on init
- client/src/pages/Languages/Languages.js: Save language on change

## Followup Steps
- Test language switching and persistence
- Verify language persists after page refresh
- Ensure fallback to 'en' if no stored language

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Added language storage key to constants
- [x] Updated i18n.js to load persisted language on initialization
- [x] Modified Languages.js to persist selected language in localStorage
